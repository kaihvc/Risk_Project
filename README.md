# Risk_Project
## Overview
This repository holds code for a research project on financial risk stability, conducted through the CU Boulder Leeds Business School.
## Instructions
To replicate the process, run the 3 "Chapter X" notebooks, setting all `load`, `recalc`, and `requery` variables to `True`, and updating the WRDS connection login 
(`wrds_username` argument to `wrds.Connection()`) to your own login info. This will take a while - we query a lot of data.
